### **Key Network Requirements**

1. **Subnet Isolation**

   - Each department must operate within its own subnet.
   - Inter-department communication should be restricted unless explicitly required. 🚧

2. **IP Addressing**

   - Use the **192.168.10.0/24** network for all departments except the server room.
   - Implement **DHCP** for dynamic IP allocation. 📡

3. **Server Room Subnet**

   - Assign static IPs from the **10.254.1.0/24** subnet for servers and critical devices. 💻

4. **Enterprise Applications**

   - Host **ERP** and **CRM** systems on local servers for seamless operations. 🖥️

5. **Redundancy & Reliability**

   - Ensure high availability with redundant systems to eliminate single points of failure. 🔄

6. **Wireless Connectivity**

   - Provide **Wi-Fi access** for the Sales & Marketing team to access internal resources. 📶

7. **Network Monitoring & Troubleshooting**

   - Deploy advanced tools for real-time monitoring and diagnostics. 🛠️

8. **Security Measures**
   - Implement robust security protocols to safeguard against cyber threats. 🛡️

## **Proposed Network Architecture & Topology**

### **Topology Design**

The network will adopt a **Hybrid Topology**, combining **Star** and **Mesh** topologies to achieve:

- **Centralized management** for efficient control. 🎯
- **Redundant pathways** to ensure uninterrupted connectivity. 🔄
- **VLAN segmentation** for enhanced security and streamlined traffic management. 🚧

### **IP Addressing Plan**

| **Department**    | **Subnet Allocation** | **IP Assignment** |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| Customer Support  | 192.168.10.0/26       | DHCP              |
| Sales & Marketing | 192.168.10.64/26      | DHCP + WiFi       |
| Finance           | 192.168.10.128/26     | DHCP              |
| Legal             | 192.168.10.192/27     | DHCP              |
| HR                | 192.168.10.224/27     | DHCP              |
| Developers        | 192.168.10.96/25      | DHCP              |
| Network Team      | 192.168.10.160/27     | DHCP              |
| Server Room       | 10.254.1.0/24         | Static            |

- **DHCP Servers** Dynamically assign IPs to all departments. 📡
- **Static IPs** Reserved for servers, routers, switches, and critical devices. 💻
