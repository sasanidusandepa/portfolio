### **Key Network Requirements**

- **Subnet Isolation** Each department must have its own unique subnet and should not communicate with other departments unless explicitly required. 🚧
- **IP Addressing** The **192.168.10.0/24** network is assigned to all departments except the server room. DHCP will be used for IP allocation. 📡
- **Server Room Subnet:** The number of required servers will be decided by the Network Architect, assigned from the **10.254.1.0/24** subnet (Static IPs). 💻
- **Enterprise Applications** ERP and CRM systems must be implemented on local servers. 🖥️
- **Redundancy & Reliability** High-level redundancy is necessary to prevent single points of failure and ensure smooth traffic flow. 🔄
- **Wireless Connectivity** Sales & Marketing employees must have Wi-Fi access to internal network resources. 📶
- **Network Monitoring & Troubleshooting:** Proper monitoring and diagnostics tools must be implemented. 🛠️
- **Security Measures** All possible network security mechanisms must be applied to prevent cyber threats. 🛡️

## **Proposed Network Architecture & Topology**

### **Topology Design**

The proposed network will utilize a **Hybrid Topology**, integrating elements of **Star** and **Mesh** Topologies for enhanced fault tolerance and load balancing. This topology provides:

- **Centralized control** with high efficiency. 🎯
- **Redundant paths** for improved reliability. 🔄
- **Segmentation through VLANs** for security and better network management. 🚧

### **IP Addressing Plan**

| **Department**    | **Subnet Allocation** | **IP Assignment** |
| ----------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| Customer Support  | 192.168.10.0/26       | DHCP              |
| Sales & Marketing | 192.168.10.64/26      | DHCP + WiFi       |
| Finance           | 192.168.10.128/26     | DHCP              |
| Legal             | 192.168.10.192/27     | DHCP              |
| HR                | 192.168.10.224/27     | DHCP              |
| Developers        | 192.168.10.96/25      | DHCP              |
| Network Team      | 192.168.10.160/27     | DHCP              |
| Server Room       | 10.254.1.0/24         | Static            |

- **DHCP Implementation** DHCP servers will be configured to allocate IPs dynamically for all departments. 📡
