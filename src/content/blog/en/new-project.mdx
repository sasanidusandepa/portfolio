# Introduction
Line-Following Robot 

A line-following robot is an autonomous robot designed to move along a predefined path, typically a black line on a white surface or vice versa. It uses infrared (IR) sensors to detect the line and adjusts its movement accordingly. These robots are commonly used in industrial automation, material handling, robotic competitions, and smart transportation systems.

Working Principle
The robot follows a black line on a white surface using IR sensors. The working mechanism is as follows:

IR Sensor Detection: The IR sensors emit infrared light and detect its reflection. A black surface absorbs light, while a white surface reflects it.

Microcontroller Processing: The Arduino Uno reads the sensor values and determines the movement.

Motor Driver Control: The L298N motor driver adjusts the motor speed and direction based on sensor feedback.


Decision Making

If both sensors detect the line, the robot moves forward.

If the left sensor moves off the line, the robot turns left.

If the right sensor moves off the line, the robot turns right.

If both sensors lose the line, the robot stops or adjusts.



ðŸ›‘Components Used

Arduino Uno (Microcontroller)

L298N Motor Driver (Motor control)

IR Sensors (TCRT5000 or similar) (Line detection)

DC Motors (For movement)

Wheels (Attached to motors)

Chassis (Base structure)

Battery Pack (Li-ion or AA batteries) (Power supply)

Switch (For turning on/off)

Connecting Wires (For circuit connections)



Arduino Code for Line-Following Robot

#define sensorLeft 2
#define sensorRight 3
#define motor1A 5
#define motor1B 6
#define motor2A 9
#define motor2B 10

  pinMode(motor2B, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  int leftValue = digitalRead(sensorLeft);
  int rightValue = digitalRead(sensorRight);

  if (leftValue == LOW && rightValue == LOW) {
    moveForward(); // Move forward
  } else if (leftValue == LOW && rightValue == HIGH) {
    turnLeft(); // Turn left
  } else if (leftValue == HIGH && rightValue == LOW) {
    turnRight(); // Turn right
  } else {
    stopMotors(); // Stop movement
  }
}

void moveForward() {
  digitalWrite(motor1A, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(motor1B, LOW);
  digitalWrite(motor2A, HIGH);
