JavaScript, commonly referred to as JS, is a versatile and powerful programming language that drives the functionality of websites and modern applications. It enables interactivity, making websites dynamic and engaging. While traditionally associated with web development, JavaScript's flexibility has extended its reach to various industries, including aerospace.

## What is JavaScript?

<Notation type="underline" color="yellow">
  JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language primarily used for developing interactive features on
  websites. It is a core technology of the web, alongside HTML and CSS
</Notation>
. JavaScript can be used for tasks such as form validation, creating animations, building web applications, and even
controlling servers through environments like Node.js. Its versatility and ease of use make it a preferred choice for
developers worldwide.

## How JavaScript is invovled in the aerospace industry?

In the aerospace industry, <Notation type="bracket" color="yellow" padding="10px" strokeWidth="2">JavaScript plays a supporting role in applications for simulation, visualization, and data analysis</Notation>. Engineers and scientists use JavaScript to create interactive dashboards for monitoring spacecraft systems and analyzing data from satellites. Additionally, JavaScript libraries such as D3.js and Three.js help visualize complex aerospace data in 2D and 3D formats. For example, JavaScript-powered web applications are often used for tracking satellites and visualizing their orbits in real-time.

```js
// Import Three.js library
import * as THREE from "three";

// Create the scene
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();

renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

// Create Earth (sphere)
const earthGeometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32, 32);
const earthMaterial = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x0000ff });
const earth = new THREE.Mesh(earthGeometry, earthMaterial);
scene.add(earth);

// Create satellite orbit (line)
const orbitPoints = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 360; i++) {
  const angle = (i * Math.PI) / 180;
  const x = Math.cos(angle) * 3; // Orbit radius
  const z = Math.sin(angle) * 3;
  orbitPoints.push(new THREE.Vector3(x, 0, z));
}
const orbitGeometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry().setFromPoints(orbitPoints);
const orbitMaterial = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 });
const orbit = new THREE.LineLoop(orbitGeometry, orbitMaterial);
scene.add(orbit);

// Position camera and render
camera.position.z = 5;
function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  earth.rotation.y += 0.01; // Earth rotation
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
animate();
```

## How to write a code in JavaScript?

To write code in JavaScript, you only need a text editor and a web browser. Below is an example of a simple JavaScript program that calculates the escape velocity needed for a rocket to leave Earth:

```js
// Function to calculate escape velocity
function calculateEscapeVelocity(mass, radius) {
  const gravitationalConstant = 6.6743e-11; // m^3 kg^-1 s^-2
  return Math.sqrt((2 * gravitationalConstant * mass) / radius);
}

// Earth's mass and radius
const earthMass = 5.972e24; // in kilograms
const earthRadius = 6371000; // in meters

// Calculate escape velocity for Earth
const escapeVelocity = calculateEscapeVelocity(earthMass, earthRadius);
console.log(`Escape velocity for Earth is ${escapeVelocity.toFixed(2)} m/s.`);
```

To run this code:

Save it in a .js file or include it in a `<script>` tag in an HTML file.
Open the file in a browser or run it in a JavaScript environment like Node.js.
JavaScript's simplicity and wide-ranging applications make it an ideal starting point for beginners and a valuable tool even in advanced fields like aerospace.
