Note 
Cable testing is a critical process in ensuring the reliability and performance of electrical and communication systems. Here are some key reasons why we test cables

Quality Assurance- Testing ensures that the cables meet the required standards and specifications, confirming they are free from manufacturing defects.

Safety- Properly tested cables reduce the risk of electrical faults, short circuits, and potential fire hazards, ensuring the safety of both equipment and personnel.

Performance Verification- Testing verifies that the cables can handle the intended electrical load and signal transmission without degradation, ensuring optimal performance.

Fault Detection- Identifying issues such as breaks, shorts, or improper connections early can prevent costly repairs and downtime in the future.

Compliance- Many industries have regulatory standards that require thorough cable testing to ensure compliance with safety and performance regulations.

Longevity- Regular testing can extend the lifespan of cables by identifying and addressing issues before they lead to failure.

Cost Efficiency- Early detection of problems through testing can save significant costs associated with equipment damage, operational interruptions, and emergency repairs

Theory of Coaxial Cable Testing at the Arthur C. Clarke Institute for Modern Technology (ACCIMT)
Introduction to Coaxial Cables
Coaxial cables are widely used for signal transmission in telecommunications, networking, radio frequency (RF) communication, and satellite communication. Their structure consists of a central conductor, dielectric insulator, metallic shield, and an outer insulating sheath. This design provides excellent shielding against electromagnetic interference (EMI), ensuring reliable signal transmission.

Purpose of Coaxial Cable Testing
Coaxial cable testing is essential for

Ensuring Signal Integrity – Verifying that the cable maintains the required signal strength and quality.
Detecting Faults – Identifying broken conductors, poor shielding, or improper terminations.
Measuring Resistance, Continuity, and Impedance – Ensuring the cable meets electrical specifications.
Testing Methods


1. Continuity Testing

Objective To check if the inner conductor and shielding are intact.
Procedure Set a digital multimeter (DMM) to the continuity or resistance mode.
Place one probe on the center conductor at one end of the cable and the other probe on the opposite end’s center conductor.
A low resistance reading (near zero) indicates continuity.
Repeat for the shielding conductor.
Result- If continuity is present, the cable is intact; if not, the cable is broken or has a faulty connection.


2. Resistance Testing

Objective To measure the cable’s electrical resistance.
Procedure Set the DMM to the appropriate resistance (Ω) range.
Measure resistance between the inner conductor at both ends.
Measure resistance between the shielding at both ends.
Result Higher-than-expected resistance indicates a fault in the conductor.


3. Short Circuit Testing

Objective To check for unintended electrical connections between conductors.
Procedure
Place one probe on the center conductor and the other on the shielding.
A reading close to zero ohms indicates a short circuit.
Result If a short circuit is detected, the cable is damaged.


4. Impedance Testing

Objective To measure the characteristic impedance (e.g., 50Ω, 75Ω).
Tools Required Time-Domain Reflectometer (TDR) or an impedance bridge.
Procedure Connect the cable to the TDR.
The TDR sends a pulse and measures reflections.
Compare the measured impedance with the cable specification.
Result Deviations from the expected impedance indicate cable degradation.


5. Signal Loss (Attenuation) Measurement

Objective To determine how much signal is lost over the cable length.
Procedure Use an RF signal generator to send a known signal power through the cable.
Measure the output power at the other end using a spectrum analyzer.
Result Higher-than-expected loss suggests cable damage or poor quality.


6. Shielding Effectiveness Testing

Objective To check the effectiveness of the coaxial shield against external interference.
Procedure Use a signal injector near the cable.
Measure the noise level using a spectrum analyzer.
Result Poor shielding can lead to high interference levels.
Conclusion
Coaxial cable testing is critical for maintaining communication reliability, especially in high-frequency applications like satellite communications at ACCIMT. Using a multimeter, TDR, and signal measurement tools, engineers can ensure cable integrity, minimize signal loss, and detect faults before deployment.
