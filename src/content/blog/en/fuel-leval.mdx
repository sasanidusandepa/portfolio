# Introduction
## what is the ESP32 Fuel Level Monitoring System?


# Conclusion
The ESP32 Fuel Level Measuring System is an IoT-based solution that measures and monitors the fuel level in a tank using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. It displays the real-time fuel percentage on an OLED display and sends the data to a Blynk mobile app for remote monitoring.config --

How It Works
Ultrasonic Sensor Measurement

The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor emits an ultrasonic pulse that bounces off the fuel surface and returns. The time taken for the pulse to return is converted into a distance measurement (fuel height). Fuel Level Calculation

The measured distance is subtracted from the total tank height to determine the fuel level.
The fuel percentage is calculated using:
```math
Fuel Percentage = \frac{(Tank Height - Measured Distance)}{Tank Height} \times 100
```

Display and Data Transmission

The OLED screen displays the fuel percentage locally.
The ESP32 sends the data to the Blynk cloud, where the fuel level is displayed on a mobile app.
