## **How the Universe Was Born?**  
The origin of the universe is one of the greatest mysteries humanity has sought to unravel. Modern science suggests that the universe was born from an event known as the Big Bang. This cataclysmic explosion marked the beginning of time, space, and matter as we know it. Before this moment, all the energy and matter in the universe were compressed into an infinitely small and dense point called a singularity.

## **When the Universe Was Born?**  
Scientists estimate that the universe was born approximately **13.8 billion years ago**. This timeline is based on observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB), which is essentially the afterglow of the Big Bang. Using advanced telescopes and instruments, astronomers have measured the expansion rate of the universe, allowing them to calculate its age with remarkable precision.

## **What’s the Big Bang Theory?**  
The Big Bang Theory is the prevailing scientific explanation for the origin of the universe. It posits that the universe began as a singularity that rapidly expanded in a fraction of a second, a process known as "inflation." During this expansion, particles, energy, and light formed, eventually giving rise to stars, galaxies, and planets.

Key evidence supporting the Big Bang Theory includes:  
1. **Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB):** The faint radiation left over from the Big Bang, discovered in 1965, provides a snapshot of the early universe.  
2. **Hubble’s Law:** Observations show that galaxies are moving away from us, indicating that the universe is expanding.  
3. **Elemental Abundance:** The proportions of hydrogen and helium observed in the universe align with predictions made by the Big Bang Theory.

## **Conclusion**  
The universe's birth remains a profound topic that inspires scientists and thinkers to explore deeper. While the Big Bang Theory provides a solid framework, questions about what preceded the singularity and the ultimate fate of the universe continue to fuel curiosity. Each discovery brings us closer to understanding the origins of existence, reminding us of the vastness and wonder of the cosmos.
